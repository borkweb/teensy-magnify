Some code for a two button interface for zooming.

## The Buttons

The right button sends the command `ALT+Command+=` for zooming in on a
Mac.

The left button sends the command `ALT+Command+-` for zooming out on a
mac.

## Background
A relative of mine has poor eyesight and, when setting up zoom on his
computer for him, he was having a lot of difficulty finding the correct
keys on the keyboard to allow him to zoom in/out (even when I re-mapped
them to `F11` and `F12`).  

I figured that he needed a device that was easy to find and control on
the desk without looking.  I searched around to try and find the right
device but came up empty.  I decided to make something that would suit
his needs...enter the [Teensy 2.0](http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html).

## Creating the device
